              <h2>About A.B.G.K Welfare organization</h2>

              <p class="lead mb-4">A.B.G.K – Anjuman Beghar Ghareeb Kiraydar is a welfare organization working for the
                rights and support of homeless individuals, poor families, and struggling tenants. Our mission is to
                provide shelter to the homeless, dignity to the poor, and justice to tenants across Pakistan. A.B.G.K
                stands as a beacon of hope for those who are helpless, displaced, or burdened by financial hardships.
              </p>
              <h2>Why This Was Started?</h2>
              <p class="lead mb-4"> A.B.G.K was established with the vision to address the growing issue of
                homelessness, poverty, and exploitation of tenants. In Pakistan, millions of people face the daily
                challenge of not having access to basic necessities, housing, and their rights as tenants. We saw the
                need to step in and make a difference by creating a space where these marginalized communities could
                find help, support, and solutions to their problems.
